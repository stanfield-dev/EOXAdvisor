A simple utility written in c# which accepts any of

- a comma separated list of part numbers
- a 'show inventory' dump
- a 'show tech' dump

... and outputs and Cisco EOL/EOS lifecycle milestone data and any recommended replacements.

Requires access to and an API key for Cisco's EOX API (which has likely changed in the many years since this was written, rendering this app inoperable).
